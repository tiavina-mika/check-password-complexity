# Contributing Guidelines

_Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!_ :octocat:

## How can I contribute?

### GitHub issues

If you encounter a problem with this library or if you have a new feature you'd like to see in this project, please create [a new issue](https://github.com/tiavina-mika/check-password-complexity/issues/new/choose).

### GitHub pull requests

Please leverage the repository's own tools to make sure the code is aligned with our standards. If you're using VSCode, it's easiest to use the recommended extensions (`.vscode/extensions.json`) to get integrated linting and autoformatting.

It's recommended to run all check commands before submitting the PR (`type:check`, `format:check`, `lint:check`, `spell:check` and `yarn lint`).

## Development setup

1. Set up [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn dev` and view the demo site at the printed localhost URL

This package uses Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so file edits should reflect immediately in your browser during local development.

To instead test a "built" version of this package which is installed into an "external" module, you can run `yarn example`, which runs a server with the separate application in the `example/` directory.

## Releasing a new version (for maintainers)

When a new version should be cut since some new changes have landed on the `main` branch, do the following to publish it:

1. Go to the `main` branch and pull in the latest changes.
2. Update the version in `package.json`.
3. Commit change using (commit convention)[https://nanthakumaran.medium.com/conventional-commits-simplify-your-project-history-and-automate-tasks-29007273e198]
4. Push the commit (ex: `git push origin main`)
5. The `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow will auto-generate a tag, change log and release note
